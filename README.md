# Randomatic
Is my first app written on Android and for Android, without using 
PC. On top of it uses [libGDX](https://github.com/libGDX/libGDX) game engine. The ".idea" folder are genearted after app was finished with AIDE on my smartphone, during dependencies upgrade. 

The app itself are really simple - one white 2d scene, where code is spawning random amount of circles, with random colors, and dynamicaly changing sizes. They will bounce out of scren edges until your ap the screen.

The main purpose of this app was to learn how to create custom java classes and controll them during their lifetime. The graphical engine gives exelent tools to see this in action.
